=============

To do:

1. Create deferreds for Player.embed() - artwork should not load before the player is embedded.
2. Create pagination for track and user lists - replaces "add more tracks/users"
3. Refactor Player
4. Split soundcloud.js into separate modules - dguzzo's fork is an example
5. Fill in missing tracks in the list - due to the track not being embeddable by all (i.e. check to see if there is a full list, add the necessary number of tracks needed to fill the list)
